# WilsonDiseaseMachineLearning (Cooperation Project)
Utilized machine learning models to classify two types of Wilson disease from training cohort blood methylation levels and predicted in the independent testing cohort.

## Notification
This is a cooperation project. I am in charge of the Machine Learning Prediction part of the study launched by Charles Mordaunt, the whole script for this project can be found in Charles Mordaunt's Github at https://github.com/cemordaunt/WilsonDiseaseEpigenome.
